      <p>* We don't know exactly what to do or exactly how we're going to do it – all we know is that in this moment, we want to collaborate on ways to somehow funnel energy into meaningful organizing.  We are against racism, sexism, xenophobia, war and everything else that might happen over the next four years.</p>
